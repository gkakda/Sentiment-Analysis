 Watching  again. Watched the episode about marshals dads last words. My dads last words were ?Did you bring me any pie?? My dad was so hungry because the hospital wouldn?t let him eat. He asked us all for food. ??
 Rewatching  and I completely forgot how I?m a little bit in love with Ted.
 Very apt programme to listen to on my way to hospital for a night shift! Truly fascinating research involved - do have a listen everyone! P.s.  I particularly loved how the doctor-to-be who diagnosed you became your wife!
